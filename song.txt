Good evening and welcome!
I'm Burnice and I'll be serving you today
What can I get for you?
A drink, some snacks - or a little flames?

Mocktails, mixers, ice
The snacks are real nice
Soda, sour-mix, dry
I’m lit you can't deny

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
So good you'll never
Ever want to leave
Anything that you desire
Set it on fire!

I'll make you spend your Dennies all away
That's my desire
You know I’m the real deal.
What's left to say?

3-2-1, fire!
Burnice, Burnice, Burnice, Burnice, Burnice, Burnice
Go go!
Burn it, Burnice, Burn it, Burnice, Burn it, Burnice
Or a little flames?
Burnice, Burnice, Burnice, Burnice, Burnice, Burnice
Go go!
Burn it, Burnice, Burn it, Burnice, Burn it, Burnice
Gonna watch it burn!
